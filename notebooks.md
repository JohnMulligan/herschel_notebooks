## Abstract

In order to

1. prepare for and and perform their observations, and
1. post-process the data gathered during these observations (for instance, in order to ready them for publication),

they had to perform many calculations and data-analytical operations. As a result, there are affordances in their archives for

1. the formal expression of the procedures they regularly employed in their data-based astronomical work, and
1. the reproduction of the operations they performed on the data attendant to particular observations.

Our ultimate goal is to enable

1. the scaled reproduction of the intellectual labor that made their observatories work &
1. the functional re-integration of their archives, 

All with reference to the original archival documents.

## Current state

A small collection of works in two different archives has been digitized. We are now pushing these to a platform that will present the media back out in a IIIF-compliant format, and preparing to link the data on a page-region basis to observations, calculations, and discoveries in external authority records (some of which already exist).

We currently have [one example](Ransom_M0672_36_25_p19__RAS_C1_1_2_p66.ipynb), specifically, a *python notebook* that

1. formalizes a method in the Ransom's M0672.36.25 file and
1. executes it on the data from the RAS's C1/1.2, as outlined in the above.

This shows a specific -- but admittedly insufficiently modular -- example of how by recording the Herschel archives on a granular level using today's information science standards, the methods used in the Herschel archive can be encoded, archived, and re-enacted according to the standards of scientific reproducibility that are now current.

## Future state

Eventually, it should be possible to make code like that provided above operationalizable across archival data that is appropriately categorized. This repository will stage that code prior to any publication/archival reintegration.
